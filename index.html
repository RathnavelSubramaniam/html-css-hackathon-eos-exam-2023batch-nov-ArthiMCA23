Being the<b> third son of Paramtaka II</b> also known as <b>Sundara Cholan and Vanavan Madevi, </b>he had great learnings from his parents and scholars. Even as a Yuvaraj, Raja Raja Cholan had great visions on his kingdom and his rule.

            </p><br>
            <p>As a staggering administrator, intense warrior, a magnanimous philanthropist, and a lover of beautiful art and architecture, Raja <b>Raja Cholan is an inevitable character in Tamizh and world history.</b> From modern-day Sri Lanka in the south to Odisha in North to Malabar Coast and the Maldives, <b>Arulmoli Varman (Raja Raja Cholan’s birth name), the Tamizh King expanded his empire throughout Asia.</b> It is widely believed that trade with the European continent was feasible during the reign (985-1014 C.E) Raja Raja Cholan.

                His political benchmark theories and generosity allowed local governance in a period where no emperor was doing it. His linchpin construction Peruvudaiyar Temple (Brihadeeswara) is the epitome of excellence since 1010 C.E. To say about Raja Raja Cholan in a single phrase – He is the KING OF KINGS. Rajendra Cholan, his son succeeded Raja Raja Cholan after his legendary father’s death in 1014 C.E.
