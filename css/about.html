          <p>The power and the prestige the Cholas had among political powers in South, Southeast, and East Asia at its peak is evident through their expeditions to the Ganges, naval raids on cities of the Srivijaya Empire based on the island of Sumatra, and their repeated embassies to China.[2] The Chola fleet represented the zenith of ancient Indian maritime capacity. Around 1070 the Cholas began to lose almost all of their overseas territories, but the later Cholas (1070–1279) continued to rule portions of southern India. The Chola empire went into decline at the beginning of the 13th century with the rise of the Pandyan dynasty, which ultimately caused their downfall.[3]

            Vijayalaya, the successor of Srikantha Chola was the founder of the Chola empire in 848 CE.[9] Vijayalaya belonging to Pottapi Chola family, a Telugu Chola branch which claimed descent from ancient Tamil king Karikala Chola[10] and possibly a feudatory of the Pallava dynasty, took an opportunity arising out of a conflict between the Pandya empire and Pallava empire in c. 850, captured Thanjavur from Muttarayar, and established the imperial line of the medieval Chola Dynasty.[11][12] Thanjavur became the capital of the Imperial Chola empire.[13]

Under Aditya I, the Pallava dynasty and defeated the Pandyan dynasty of Madurai in 885, occupied large parts of the Kannada country, and had marital ties with the Western Ganga dynasty. In 925, his son Parantaka I conquered Sri Lanka (known as Ilangai). Parantaka I also defeated the Rashtrakuta dynasty under Krishna II in the battle of Vallala.[14] Later Parantaka I was defeated by Rashtrakutas under Krishna III and Cholas' heir apparent Rajaditya Chola was killed in the Battle of Takkolam. Cholas lost Tondaimandalam region to Rashtrakutas in that battle.

                Rajendra I proclaimed as Emperor by Shiva and Shakthi.
                Under Rajaraja I and Rajendra I, the Empire would reach it's impereal state.[15] At its peak, the Chola empire stretched from the northern parts of Sri Lanka in the south to the Godavari–Krishna river basin in the north, up to the Konkan coast in Bhatkal, the entire Malabar Coast (the Chea country) in addition to Lakshadweep, and Maldives. Rajaraja Chola I was a ruler with inexhaustible energy, and he applied himself to the task of governance with the same zeal that he had shown in waging wars. He integrated his empire into a tight administrative grid under royal control, and at the same time strengthened local self-government. Therefore, he conducted a land survey in 1000 CE to effectively marshall the resources of his empire.[16] He also built the Brihadeeswarar Temple in 1010.[17]</p><br>
